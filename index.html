                        Hey Rubss! Cheers to another year of making it through together! I can’t believe it’s been 4 amazing years already - time really does fly! Right? On your special day, I wish you good luck and a lifetime of health and happiness. Remember, no matter what, I'm always here for you. Thank you for your love, support and for tolerating me all these years(and for the ones to come). Wishing you the happiest of birthdays once again! Here’s to many more years of laughter and unforgettable memories! Love you!

                        From just knowing you for years to really getting to know you these past six months, our friendship has become truly special. You’ve been there through all of my stupid rants, never wavering in your support! Wishing my friend another wonderful year filled with happiness and joy. You deserve nothing but the best! Let go of the past, you can't change it. Don't worry about the future, you can't predict it [Overthink pannaadha raasaa]. And forget about the present, I didn't get you one. Happiest Bornday Ruby!!

                        Hi there!! Congratulations on successfully completing the 22nd iteration of the loop of your life, where our paths crossed, creating a never-ending linked list of sweet memories. Here's to another iteration of the loop, where the function of life always returns happiness and success. Once again, happy birthday, mon frère! I'm excitedly awaiting our reunion.
